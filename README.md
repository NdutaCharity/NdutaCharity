   ###    💻 Enrolled in the **ALX Software Engineering Programme, Cohort 5**
   
   ###    :muscle: Flexing my [Data Analytics](https://github.com/NdutaCharity/Data_Analytics/) skills here.
   
  ##    ⚙ Currently levelling up my skills in:

          🛠 SQL for queries
          🛠 Excel
          🛠 Power BI, Tableau
          🛠 Python and R
          🛠 Earth Observation
           
   **Fun Fact** : _When not dealing with data and maps (which I really enjoy), I am either hiking, being in nature or reading.
      I love me some fiction, throw in some Stephen King or Dean  Koontz and hello best friend.
      Lately, I am invested in African authored books._
